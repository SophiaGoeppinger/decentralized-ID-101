# Decentralized Identity 101: A Starter Library for Novices
A curated list of resources introducing decentralized identity and related concepts for beginners.

**Starter library curators:** Sophia Goeppinger and Matt Murray

---

Decentralized identity (ID), as we perceive it today, is a novel concept, yet its foundational elements have roots stretching back decades, some even predating the advent of the modern internet. While this field is burgeoning with diverse resources, navigating through this digital maze can be overwhelming, especially for those just beginning their journey. That's where we step in. Our mission is to **demystify decentralized ID for beginners by carefully curating a comprehensive starter library**. We aim to bridge the gap between complex jargon and foundational understanding, ensuring that these resources are accessible, relevant, and engaging.

Before diving into our library, we encourage you to take a quick glance at our "Target Audience Checklist" below. This will help you gauge if these resources align perfectly with your learning stage and interests in decentralized ID.

## Start Here: Target Audience Checklist
Are you our target audience? Find out if you'll benefit from our curated resources. Simply go through the checklist below and see if any of these points resonate with you:

- [ ] **Absolute Beginner:** I've recently come across terms like "decentralized ID", "decentralized digital ID", or "self-sovereign identity (SSI)" and am curious, but my knowledge doesn't extend much beyond the names themselves.
- [ ] **Developer on the Cusp:** I'm a developer whose organization is exploring or even beginning to implement decentralized ID. While my experience in development is solid, my familiarity with decentralized ID is still budding.
- [ ] **Decision Maker Seeking Clarity:** I hold a decision-making role in my organization where decentralized ID is on the table as a potential project. While I'm not well-versed in the specifics, I'm seeking a concise, clear overview of decentralized ID that fits into my busy schedule without requiring extensive time commitment.
- [ ] **Following Sophia's Assessment Tool:** I've been directed here from Sophia Goeppinger's Decentralized ID Checklist. I'm looking for detailed information to complement the assessment framework or seek specific insights referenced in that tool _(Note: Feel welcomed to browse around or jump straight to Section 6, dedicated exclusively to the references made in the Decentralized ID Checklist)._

## 1. Intro
Welcome! It's fantastic to have you here. Below, you'll find a curated **list of resources** designed to kickstart your journey into the world of decentralized ID. These resources are thoughtfully organized by level of expertise and depth. As you delve deeper down the list, the content becomes more detailed. Items marked with a star (*) are advanced and may be more suitable for those further along in their understanding, but feel free to explore these as well based on your knowledge and curiosity. In addition to our resource list, we offer an overview of selected **conferences** that we find particularly beneficial, as well as a list of **associations** dedicated to the advancement of decentralized ID in its various forms. Lastly, we provide a list of **decentralized ID initiatives** sorted by sector for inspiration. 

**But, a word of caution before you dive in:** The decentralized ID community, like many others, is diverse and somewhat fragmented. Although there's a collective direction, individuals and groups within the community have their unique perspectives on the best practices and methodologies. This is crucial to remember, particularly for newcomers, as initial interactions could subtly influence your understanding based on specific viewpoints. To simplify, we see the community as comprising 2.5 key groups. The first group includes those who shaped the landscape as we currently know it, recognizable through social log-in interfaces like Facebook and Google. The second group focuses on Verifiable Identifiers, working with concepts like DIDs and AIDs (don't worry if these terms mean absolutely nothing to you at this stage). The "half" group encompasses the blockchain enthusiasts, who, despite seeming a bit distant, remain a significant part of this ecosystem.

In this guide, our goal is to remain objective, prioritizing quality over ideology. We've sourced, in our opinion, the finest materials from all these streams, allowing you to form your own informed opinions. This should give you enough context to start your exploration. Happy browsing!

## 4. Decentralized ID Associations
The table below lists association that try to drive this novel field of decentralized ID forward in a various of different ways:
| Type             | Association Name | Description                  
| :--------------- |:---------------- | :--------------------------- 
|Conference|[Internet Identity Workshop (IIW)](https://internetidentityworkshop.com)|The Internet Identity Workshop has been finding, probing and solving identity issues twice every year since 2005. We meet in the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, CA. Every IIW moves topics, code and projects downfield. Name an identity topic and it’s likely that more substantial discussion and work has been done at IIW than any other conference! IIW is more focused on the US digital identity landscape.
|Conference|[Rebooting the Web of Trust (RWOT)](https://www.weboftrust.info)|RWOT reboots the classic model of a decentralized web of trust through organized collaborative gatherings. These include both virtual salons and in-person design workshops, all focused on the creation of the next generation of decentralized web-of-trust based identity systems. These events are about germinating new ideas and producing finalized content that presents those ideas to the larger community. RWOT is more focused on the European digital identity landscape.
|Foundation|[Trust over IP Foundation](https://trustoverip.org) |
|Foundation|[Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF)](https://www.gleif.org/en)|Established by the Financial Stability Board in June 2014, GLEIF is tasked to support the implementation and use of the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI). The foundation is backed and overseen by the Regulatory Oversight Committee, representing public authorities from around the globe that have come together to jointly drive forward transparency within the global financial markets. GLEIF is a supra-national not-for-profit organization headquartered in Basel, Switzerland.
