### Exemplary decentralized ID initiatives 
These initiatives may serve as an inspiration for your decentralized ID endeavors
| Sector      | Consortium/Organization(s) | Decentralized ID Initiative  | Description                  | Contributor |
| :---------- | :------------------------- | :--------------------------- | :--------------------------- | :---------- |
| Healthcare | [Open Credentialing Initiative (OCI)](https://www.oc-i.org) | OCI | The Open Credentialing Initiative is a collaborative industry effort enabling pharmaceutical supply chain actors to establish digital proof of identity, licensure status and information authorship using digital wallets and verifiable credentials. | Sophia Goeppinger
| Cross-sector | [Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF)](https://www.gleif.org/en) | [Legal Entity Identifier (LEI)](https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/introducing-the-legal-entity-identifier-lei) | The Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) is a 20-character, alpha-numeric code based on the ISO 17442 standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). It connects to key reference information that enables clear and unique identification of legal entities participating in financial transactions. | Sophia Goeppinger
### Decentralized ID Associations
The table below lists association that try to drive this novel field of decentralized ID forward in a various of different ways:
| Type             | Association Name | Description                  |  Contributor |
| :--------------- |:---------------- | :--------------------------- |  :---------- |
| Foundation | [Trust over IP Foundation](https://trustoverip.org) | | Sophia Goeppinger
| Foundation | [Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF)](https://www.gleif.org/en) | Established by the Financial Stability Board in June 2014, GLEIF is tasked to support the implementation and use of the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI). The foundation is backed and overseen by the Regulatory Oversight Committee, representing public authorities from around the globe that have come together to jointly drive forward transparency within the global financial markets. GLEIF is a supra-national not-for-profit organization headquartered in Basel, Switzerland. | Sophia Goeppinger
| Conference | [Internet Identity Workshop (IIW)](https://internetidentityworkshop.com) | The Internet Identity Workshop has been finding, probing and solving identity issues twice every year since 2005. We meet in the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, CA. Every IIW moves topics, code and projects downfield. Name an identity topic and it’s likely that more substantial discussion and work has been done at IIW than any other conference! IIW is more focused on the US digital identity landscape. | Sophia Goeppinger
| Conference | [Rebooting the Web of Trust (RWOT)](https://www.weboftrust.info) | RWOT reboots the classic model of a decentralized web of trust through organized collaborative gatherings. These include both virtual salons and in-person design workshops, all focused on the creation of the next generation of decentralized web-of-trust based identity systems. These events are about germinating new ideas and producing finalized content that presents those ideas to the larger community. RWOT is more focused on the European digital identity landscape.
